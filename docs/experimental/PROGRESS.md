# Experimental work log and resume point

Stable invariants: leave `main`, tag `v1.2.0`, stable release downloads and its updater untouched. Work and push only `experimental`. No DCS installation is available here; record simulator checks as outstanding.

## Batch 1 — separate experimental identity

Implemented separate installer AppId, name and installation directory; separate default preferences/logs, cache and missions directories; numeric experimental version 1.3.0 and planned prerelease tag `v1.3.0-experimental.1`. Default update checks refuse the stable feed. Environment overrides remain intentional developer/test controls.

Validation: 112 existing model/preferences/updater tests passed. Additional identity guards are included. Packaging has not yet been rebuilt; the old stable Windows build script must be replaced or adapted for experimental packaging before use.

## Next batches

1. Functional cooperative objectives, optional consequences and one bounded ground response; Lua 5.1 regression tests and actual archive checks.
2. Desktop operation/distance controls, richer briefing/kneeboard, replay/presets without extra aircraft/map requirements.
3. Separate experimental Windows build and prerelease; coexistence validation beside stable 1.2.0.
4. Update this log with exact validation and any remaining limits before ending a batch.

Python: `/workspace/.venvs/ironanvil/bin/python`. For complete cloud tests prepend `/workspace/.cloud-tools/usr/bin` to PATH and run under `xvfb-run -a`. GitHub API is unavailable directly in this cloud; authenticated repository pushes and workflows work. Public workflow pages and release downloads can be inspected with urllib; use a timestamp query to avoid stale cached status.
